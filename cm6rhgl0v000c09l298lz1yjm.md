[My tech career](https://blog.hijabicoder.dev/my-2022-reflections-dev-retro-2022) has always been one of exploration, curiosity, and experimentation. Over the years, I have tried UI design, Frontend, Mobile Multi-platform, Serverless, Microservices, Databases, Open-source, and Technical writing. I even took a brief detour into DevOps - and quickly turned back ðŸ˜…. It was clear that it just wasnâ€™t my thing.

![A toddler runs down a hallway with excitement, wearing a black shirt and patterned pants, before turning around getting and going back quickly.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1738311194235/d4225dd3-3a27-4ce6-9e19-0ad47249801e.gif align="center")

This enabled me to gain a broad understanding of development work and clarified what I was good at and which parts I enjoyed the most. No surprise that, as a creative, artsy, and poetic person - I have firmly come back around to frontend, design systems, and product documentation.

## Key Technical Achievements Iâ€™m Proud Of

During my exploration stage, I had some technical achievements that I'm proud of, including:

* Leading the [exploratory transition of Wikimediaâ€™s Design System](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T374275) from Figma to Penpot.
    
* Simplified authentication for Flutter and Supabase users by contributing a [helper auth library with ready-to-use widgets](https://github.com/supabase-community/flutter-auth-ui). The library has 13 contributors, 59 GitHub stars, and 29 forks. It is on [Pub.dev](http://Pub.dev) and has a 73% popularity score.
    
* [Added a working mobile version of the playground editor](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/pull/2076), making learning [Ocaml.org](http://Ocaml.org) accessible to mobile users for the first time.
    
* [Increased web accessibility levels of OpenSaucedâ€™s codebase](https://github.com/open-sauced/app/issues/2264) by co-leading efforts with [Nick Taylor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickytonline/), Developer Advocate at [Pomerium](https://www.pomerium.com/), to enforce the standards via JSX-ally-plugin.
    
* [Added product guides to OpenSaucedâ€™s documentation](https://github.com/open-sauced/docs/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AFatumaA+is%3Aclosed) to help onboard new developers to common terms used in the open-source space.
    
* Successfully migrated an unfamiliar JavaScript codebase over to using strict TypeScript.
    
* Optimizing database reads by breaking apart large backend functions into smaller microservices.
    

## Key Community and Content Engagements Iâ€™m Proud Of

Beyond code, I also participate in the community by giving talks, writing tutorials, and organizing events. Some of the work Iâ€™m most proud of includes:

* [Talking about accessibility and authentication at DevFest Pwani](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fatuma-abdullahi-6b804948_last-saturday-i-physically-spoke-at-a-devfest-activity-7267091320236634112-RTYL?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) and [getting featured in their highlight video](https://www.youtube.com/clip/Ugkx1DGLUi4ZCwV9jufaHoJRQscy-NBbAfXI).
    
* Joining [Supabaseâ€™s SupaSquad](https://supabase.com/open-source/contributing/supasquad) - an unofficial group of advocates.
    
* Organizing [multiple events for Supabaseâ€™s launch week](https://x.com/XquisiteDreamer/status/1828748900616024379) across two cities. And having a turnout of about 40%.
    
* Getting accepted into the [Road to GDE](https://blog.google/technology/developers/road-to-gde-supporting-future-google-developer-experts/) cohort 3 program
    
* Becoming a [FreeCodeCamp author](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/HijabiCoder/).
    
* Becoming a Guest Author on [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/author/fatumaabdullaho/) and [Cerbos](https://www.cerbos.dev/blog/how-to-use-cerbos-in-docker-compose-pdp-hub).
    
* Becoming a volunteer community manager for [Open Source Community Africa (OSCA)](https://oscafrica.org/).
    

## So, Whatâ€™s Next for my Tech Career?

My next goal is to land a remote full-time or part-time role, ideally within the open-source ecosystem.

### The Perfect Organization

Iâ€™d be most excited to work with organizations that are:

* Open-source, open core, or that give back to open source in some way.
    
* Concerned with building accessible products.
    
* In the DevTool space or that are working towards a noble goal greater than themselves. For example, Wikimediaâ€™s goal is to democratize the worldâ€™s knowledge.
    
* Fully remote, hiring globally, or that are willing to offer relocation sponsorship.
    

### The Perfect Role

Iâ€™d be most excited to work on the following verticals:

* Frontend heavy full-stack roles
    
* Frontend roles that include building and maintaining design systems in code or design tools.
    
* Frontend plus working on product documentation and tools.
    
* Technical Developer Experience (DX) roles
    

### Why You Should Hire Me

Here are some reasons Iâ€™d be a fit for your team:

* **All-Rounded Product Developer -** I have a broad general understanding of the entire product lifecycle, giving me a unique perspective on building user-friendly and scalable products.
    
* **Frontend and Design Systems-** I have experience using modern technologies like React.js, Next.js, Astro, and Tailwind. I also have experience working with [design systems](https://blog.hijabicoder.dev/taking-apart-and-putting-together-wikimedias-design-system).
    
* [**Web Accessibility Advocate**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQUZAKWELr0) â€“ I co-led [accessibility improvements in OpenSaucedâ€™s codebase](https://github.com/open-sauced/app/issues/2264) and actively share [accessibility best practices](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fatuma-abdullahi-6b804948_last-saturday-i-physically-spoke-at-a-devfest-activity-7267091320236634112-RTYL?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).
    
* **Open-Source and Community Presence -** I [share what I learn](https://blog.hijabicoder.dev/) and Iâ€™m an active member of the tech community.
    
* **Remote experience -** I have professional, remote, and open-source experience. I can work in async environments and collaborate across cultures and time zones.
    

### When Can I Start?

Iâ€™m ready to start in March 2025, when my current project at Wikimedia will be ending. You can reach me via [Twitter](https://x.com/XquisiteDreamer), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fatuma-abdullahi-6b804948/) or [Email](mailto:fatuma@hijabicoder.dev).

You can also reach out to any of these amazing open-source developers Iâ€™ve collaborated with:

* [Sabine Schmaltz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sabfis/), [OCaml.org](http://OCaml.org) Maintainer, Developer Relations at [Tarides](https://tarides.com/)\- I worked closely with Sabine on [making front-end changes to Ocaml.orgâ€™s website](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AFatumaA+is%3Aclosed).
    
* [Tyler Shukert](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dshukertjr/), Developer Relations at [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) - I worked with Tyler to bring [Flutter Auth UI](https://github.com/supabase-community/flutter-auth-ui) to life.
